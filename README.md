These are PAM configuration files for demonstration purposes. They always allow authentication with your Linux system password as a last resort.

## Globally enable U2F for login

Extensions show changes to the sudo and common-auth files in ```/etc/pam.d```.

Make sure you know what you are doing, this can lock you out of your system permanently!

The U2F keyfile must reside outside of an encrypted home-directory, e.g. we could use ```/etc```.

```bash
pamu2fcfg -u$USER | sudo tee /etc/u2f_keys
```

The modified setup has been tested with Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu Linux 20.04 LTS.

Passwordless login won't work with ecryptfs encrypted home directories in the default Ubuntu configuration. You could still configure a 2-factor authentication if you want of course.

## General setup

Attention: For Authentication with face recognition, U2F token and PIN you have to install and configure the respective PAM libraries first. The details are explained in the articles.

```tsv
inc-pin+howdy-pw	PIN+Face / Password
inc-pin+u2f-pw		PIN+U2F-Token / Password
inc-u2f+howdy-pw	U2F+Face / Password
inc-u2f-pw		U2F-Token / Passwort
```

For demo installation purposes, copy these files to /etc/pam.d:

```bash
cd pam-demos/
sudo cp inc-* /etc/pam.d/
```

and replace for example in /etc/pam.d/sudo the line with "common-auth":

```patch
-@include common-auth

+@include inc-u2f-pw
+# @include common-auth
```

Afterwards, test with e.g. ```sudo -k id``` if things work (both U2F and normal password should work).

## Global initialization

If you are satisfied, you can transfer the changes to common-auth as shown in the example file in this repository. If you just want to enable U2F globally, just copy the contained common-auth to the /etc/pam.d/ directory.

Good luck.
